In this folder, there are all the files needed to test the database.
First, download all the files in one folder.
Then open the Interface.py. If your MySQL has password, please modify the password in the beginning of the interface.
In the interface, each function is noted that who implements the function, and the views, procedures, triggers and functions are in the folder,
and feel free to watch the code.
